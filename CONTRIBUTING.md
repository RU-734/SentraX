# Contributing to SentraX

## Introduction
Welcome to SentraX! We are excited about your interest in contributing to our project. We appreciate you taking the time to help us make SentraX a better tool for cybersecurity professionals. All contributions, from bug reports to new features, are welcome.

Thank you for considering contributing!

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, please refer to the following sections in our `README.md`:
*   **System Architecture**: For an overview of the frontend, backend, and data storage.
*   **Deployment Strategy**: For instructions on setting up your local development environment, including running the application.
*   **Database Setup**: For information on setting up the PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM.

The key technologies used in this project are:
*   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Wouter, React Query
*   **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js
*   **Language**: TypeScript (for both frontend and backend)
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

Familiarizing yourself with these technologies and the project structure described in the `README.md` will be helpful.

## How to Contribute

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests.

### Reporting Bugs
If you encounter a bug, please help us by submitting an issue on GitHub. To ensure we can address it effectively, please include the following information:
*   **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear and concise steps to replicate the bug.
*   **Expected Behavior**: What you expected to happen.
*   **Actual Behavior**: What actually happened, including any error messages.
*   **Environment Details**: Your operating system, browser version, Node.js version, etc., if relevant.
*   **Screenshots or Recordings**: If possible, these can be very helpful in understanding the issue.

### Suggesting Enhancements
We welcome your ideas for enhancing SentraX! You can submit feature requests or enhancement ideas via GitHub Issues.
*   Clearly describe the proposed enhancement and the problem it aims to solve.
*   Explain why this enhancement would be beneficial to SentraX users.
*   If you're planning to implement the enhancement yourself, it's a good idea to discuss it in the issue first to ensure it aligns with the project's goals and to coordinate efforts.

### Your First Code Contribution
If you're looking for a place to start contributing code, check for issues tagged with "good first issue" or "help wanted" on GitHub. These issues are typically well-defined and suitable for new contributors.

Before you start coding, make sure you have set up your development environment as described in the `README.md` under "Deployment Strategy" and "Database Setup".

### Pull Request Process
1.  **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page on GitHub.
2.  **Clone Your Fork**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentrax.git`
3.  **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch from the `main` branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name, for example:
    *   For features: `git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature`
    *   For bug fixes: `git checkout -b bugfix/fix-for-issue-123`
4.  **Make Your Changes**: Write your code and make sure to adhere to the coding standards (see below).
5.  **Include Tests**: Add unit tests or integration tests that cover your changes. Untested code will likely not be merged. (Refer to existing tests in `server/tests/` for examples).
6.  **Ensure Code Lints and Tests Pass**:
    *   Run `npm run check` to check for TypeScript errors.
    *   Run `npm run test` to execute the test suite.
    *   (Placeholder: We will be adding ESLint and Prettier soon for automated linting and formatting.)
7.  **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commit message standards if possible, or at least ensure your messages are clear and descriptive of the changes made in each commit.
8.  **Push Your Branch**: Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature`
9.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the original SentraX repository on GitHub and open a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the SentraX repository.
10. **Describe Your PR**: Provide a clear and concise description of the changes in your pull request. Explain the "what" and "why" of your contribution. Link to any relevant GitHub issues (e.g., "Fixes #123" or "Implements #456").
11. **Respond to Feedback**: Project maintainers and other contributors may review your PR and provide feedback or request changes. Please be responsive to these comments.

## Coding Standards
*   **TypeScript**: The project uses TypeScript extensively. Please follow standard TypeScript best practices, including using types effectively and writing clean, maintainable code.
*   **Readability**: Write code that is easy to understand. Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
*   **Formatting**: (Placeholder: We are working on setting up ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting. In the meantime, please ensure your code is well-formatted and readable. Try to match the style of the existing codebase.)
*   **Tests**: All new features and bug fixes should ideally be accompanied by tests.

## Code of Conduct
We aim to foster an open and welcoming environment. As such, we expect all contributors to adhere to a high standard of professional conduct and to treat everyone with respect. Harassment, discrimination, or any form of disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.

(Placeholder: A more formal Code of Conduct, potentially based on the Contributor Covenant, will be added soon. In the interim, please uphold these principles of respect and professionalism.)

## Questions & Communication
If you have any questions, need clarification, or want to discuss an idea before starting significant work, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub. We will do our best to respond in a timely manner.

Thank you again for your interest in contributing to SentraX!
